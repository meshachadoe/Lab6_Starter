I made a few adjustments, but I\u2019m sure it is great as is too! I make mine with chicken, and I saut\u00e9ed the green onions with the garlic for some extra flavor. I also like more suave so I doubled the sauce recipe. And added an extra egg for some extra protein. It is decently spicy so I cut the cayenne in half for my kids. My husband, 6 year old and 3 year old can\u2019t get enough and everyone has seconds.

It is very good but great with a couple small modifications.I added sugar snap peas ( steamed a bit) to give it crunch and color. Like others I added a little peanut butter ( not too much! it goes a long way. you can add more later if needed. No way is the prep time 10 minutes...more like 20.

Made this last night and it was so good. Your recipe allowed me to feel okay about substitutions... no bean sprouts was good! I didn\u2019t have tamarind (I\u2019m in my RV) so I used balsamic vinegar and extra lime juice. I did not boil the rice noodles, they do not need it. Just soaked them in hot water.
